                <h2>Show Renamer</h2>
                <p>This application renames show files to a better format. The idea was to create an application in order to gain some experience using APIs within a GUI application. I made a service which created a worker thread for each file read in, calling a movie database API on the title of the file, returning a JSON object which is used to get a better suggestion for the file name. Threading is very important in an application like this to make sure it does not block the UI thread and freeze the application.</p>

                <h2>Rocket League Private Matches Discord Bot</h2>
                <p>I created a Discord bot in Python using the Discord API wrapper <span><a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord">Pycord</a></span>. This bot can be used in a discord server when a group of 6 people queue for a private match game, each having their match making rating (mmr) set. The users in the game get to vote on how to balance teams with random teams, balanced teams (based on mmr) or by having two captains pick.</p>

                <h2>CCTV Security Software</h2>
                <p>With a Raspberry Pi and Pi cam, I created this application for my A Level Computer Science coursework. The goal was to create a security system that was low cost and could run automatically throughout all hours of the day to monitor the entrance of an office and take pictures while motion was detected. I also built a GUI to log the user in and to create an easy way to view the camera in real time, view & delete pictures taken and to adjust settings.</p>
